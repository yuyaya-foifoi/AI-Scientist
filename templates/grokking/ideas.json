Modular exponentiation is chosen due to its higher computational complexity compared to addition or subtraction, while varying permutation orders adds another layer of combinatorial complexity. Modify the existing experimentation loop to include these new datasets. Compare the generalization performance using metrics such as speed of achieving 99% accuracy, final accuracy, and training loss across these different datasets to analyze how operation complexity affects grokking.",
